      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>LGBTQ+ panic has been a reason for violence in this country for decades. People find that since a person is differnet from them, that they have a right to brutalize them for no reason.</p>

      <h2>Statistics</h2>
      <!-- Add text, images, and links for section 2 below. -->
      <p>In previous statistics involving the justification behind certain hate crimes, sexual/gender identity/representation ranked third behind race and religion</p>
      <p>Currently, only eighteen states have this defense banned, while the rest (including U.S. territories) still allow it as a valid defense. People can justify the assault and even murder of others by saying the attack was valid because they were a part of the LGBTQ+ community</p>
      <p>This defense promotes the harmful stigma that members of the LGBTQ+ people are scary, harmful, and dangerous and spreads homophobia as well as transphobia.</p>

      <h2>Solution</h2>
      <!-- Add text, images, and links for section 3 below. -->
      <p>Sign a petition in order to ban the legality of the defense within your state courts. We need to get this defense banned in every state in order to further the reasons that members of the LGBTQ+ can come out safely and securly.</p>
